# About

I'm a Software Engineer who loves [Rick and Morty](http://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty/). I also love watching [animes](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1maa414tmM5iKOrWWkQ6pWR38OrQhUrZaB-KqHjO9M-w/edit?usp=sharing). They are really weird and fascinating.

I love playing competitive computer games and board games. I was a semi-pro League of Legends player. Some of my achievements are:

* League of Legends EU West Server - Diamond League (Top %0.1)
* League of Legends Turkey Server - Challenger League (Top 50)
* League of Legends – Riot Turkey - 2013 Winter 5v5 team tournement 4th place
* League of Legends – Riot Turkey - 2013 Spring 5v5 team tournement 4th place
* Hearthstone - EU Server - Legend (Top 200)
* Tetrisbattle - Grandmaster League (Top %0.1)
* Age of Empires II - Top 1000

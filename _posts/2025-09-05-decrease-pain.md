# We Are Barbaric, Here Is Why?

![](/assets/posts/pain_barbar.jpeg)

As societies mature, the total amount of acceptable pain decreases. What was once normal becomes barbaric. What's acceptable today will be unthinkable tomorrow.

## Pain Reduction Through History

Here's what humans used to consider normal:

| Era | Pain That Was Normal | How It Ended |
|-----|---------------------|--------------|
| **Ancient (384 BCE)** | Burying servants alive with rulers | China banned it, used clay figures instead <sup>[1](https://terracottawarriorsmuseum.com/why-terracotta-warriors-were-built/)</sup> |
| **Classical (97 BCE)** | Fathers legally killing newborns they didn't want | This was legal under patria potestas in Rome <sup>[2](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Patria_Potestas.html)</sup> |
| **Late Antiquity (500 CE)** | Forced religious conversions | Church and imperial reforms stopped it <sup>[3](https://academic.oup.com/forced-conversion/)</sup> |
| **Medieval (1215)** | Marrying 9-year-old girls to old men | Church gradually raised marriage age <sup>[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriageable_age)</sup> |
| **Early Modern (1666)** | Young boys seized from families, converted, forced into millitary service | Abolished under Sultan Mehmed IV <sup>[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devshirme)</sup> |
| **Industrial (1833)** | Child factory labor | UK banned it, mandated school instead <sup>[6](https://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/livinglearning/19thcentury/overview/factoryact/)</sup> |
| **Contemporary (2024)** | Gayness is a mental disease | Gay marriage is allowed in many countries <sup>[7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage)</sup> |

> Each generation looks back at the previous one and asks: "How could they?"

## Three Types of Pain We've Reduced

### 1. Physical Pain

The most obvious category. 
- Torture as legal punishment (Prussia 1740 <sup>[8](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-hccc-worldhistory2/chapter/prussia-under-frederick-the-great/)</sup>, Sweden 1772 <sup>[9](https://nordstjernan.com/news/sweden/5740/)</sup>)
- Gladiatorial killings (Rome 404 CE <sup>[10](https://penelope.uchicago.edu/encyclopaedia_romana/gladiators/gladiators.html)</sup>)
- Dueling for honor (France 1626 <sup>[11](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874270)</sup>)
- Public executions as entertainment

### 2. Systemic Pain

Pain built into how society operates:
- Homicide rates dropped 95% from medieval to modern times <sup>[12](https://www.vrc.crim.cam.ac.uk/system/files/documents/manuel-eisner-historical-trends-in-violence.pdf)</sup>
- Child mortality: 12.5M → 4.8M deaths/year (1990-2023) <sup>[13](https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-survival/under-five-mortality/)</sup>
- Unsafe water access: 2.1B people gained clean water (2000-2022) <sup>[14](https://data.unicef.org/resources/jmp-report-2023/)</sup>
- Cousin marriage: Banned in most Western countries by 1900s <sup>[15](https://americanreformer.org/2025/03/a-protestant-approach-to-first-cousin-marriage-bans/)</sup>

### 3. Hidden Pain

Pain we didn't even recognize as pain:
- Animal testing for cosmetics (45 countries banned by 2025) <sup>[16](https://www.britannica.com/procon/animal-testing-debate/International-Cosmetics-Animal-Testing-Bans)</sup>
- Wild animals in circuses (dozens of bans 2000s-2020s) <sup>[17](https://www.four-paws.org/campaigns-topics/topics/wild-animals/worldwide-circus-bans)</sup>
- Fur farming (production collapsed 2014-2024) <sup>[18](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/421653/fur-farming-decline-animal-rights-mink-fixes)</sup>
- Child marriage (dropped from 1-in-4 to 1-in-5 women 2013→2024) <sup>[19](https://www.unicefusa.org/media-hub/reports/trends-forecast-ending-child-marriage-2030)</sup>

## What Pain Are We Solving Now?

Current trends show what's disappearing:

| Pain Being Reduced | Progress | Timeline |
|-------------------|----------|----------|
| **Deadly diseases** | Guinea worm, HIV deaths plummeting | 1986→now <sup>[20](https://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/2025/2024-guinea-worm-worldwide-cases-announcement.html)</sup> |
| **Air pollution** | Clean air acts, EV adoption, coal phase-outs | 2000s <sup>[21](https://www.who.int/teams/social-determinants-of-health/safety-and-mobility/global-status-report-on-road-safety-2023)</sup> |
| **Factory farming** | Lab meat rising | 2020s <sup>[22](https://gfi.org/marketresearch/)</sup> |
| **Mental health stigma** | Therapy normalized | 2010s <sup>[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)</sup> |

## What Pain Will We Solve Next?

**Physical pain:**
- Genetic disorder (designer babies)
- Needing to brush teeth 
- Aging (treating it as a disease)
- Disabilities (prostetics organic eyes, ears, limbs)

**Systemaic pain:**
- 2 billion without clean water
- 150M children in labor
- 700M people in extreme poverty
- 1B living in slums

**Hidden pain:**
- <span class="spoiler">We don't know what we don't know yet.


</span>

> The pain we accept today will be tomorrow's human rights violation.

## Sometimes Pain Increases

Not all progress is linear. Sometimes we invent new ways to hurt before we learn to heal.

### The Pain Curve

Most "pain increases" follow this lifecycle:

**Innovation → Pain spike → We adapt → Better world**

![](/assets/posts/pain_curve.png)

New tech creates pain. We notice it. Fix it. End up better.

### When Pain Gets Worse Before It Gets Better

| Innovation | Pain It Created | How We Fixed It |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Cars** | 1.3M deaths/year at peak | Seatbelts, airbags, traffic laws → safer than horses |
| **Factories** | Child labor, industrial accidents | Labor laws, safety regulations → safer than farms |
| **Leaded gasoline** | Poisoned entire generation | Banned globally → IQ recovery |
| **Social media** | Depression, addiction, polarization | (Ongoing) Age limits, time limits, algorithm changes |
| **Plastic** | Microplastics in every human body | (Ongoing) Biodegradable alternatives, cleanup tech |

> New tech creates new pain. Society notices. We fix it. End up better than before.

Overtime, the pattern looks more like this, with lots of spikes. Where some pain takes 10 years, some takes 500 years to decrease.

## The Pattern

1. **Recognition**: Someone points out the pain
2. **Resistance**: "That's just how things are"
3. **Regulation**: Laws and social norms restrict it
4. **Replacement**: Better alternatives emerge
5. **Disgust**: Future generations can't believe we allowed it

This pattern repeats. Always has. Always will.

## Conclusion

You can measure a society's development by how much pain it considers unacceptable. 

We went from burying servants with kings to thinking a stern email from HR is abuse. From burning witches to giving woman voting rights. From 6-year-olds in coal mines to mandatory kindergarten.

> Every generation has blind spots. Ours does too.

What pain do you accept today that your grandchildren won't?
